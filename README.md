I'm excited to share a project I recently completed — an 𝐎𝐫𝐭𝐡𝐨𝐩𝐞𝐝𝐢𝐜𝐬 𝐀𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐭𝐢𝐜𝐬 𝐃𝐚𝐬𝐡𝐛𝐨𝐚𝐫𝐝 built entirely using 𝐌𝐢𝐜𝐫𝐨𝐬𝐨𝐟𝐭 𝐄𝐱𝐜𝐞𝐥! 💻📊
🔍 𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗶𝘁 𝗶𝗻𝗰𝗹𝘂𝗱𝗲𝘀: 
✔️ Monthly Patient Satisfaction Scores
✔️ Patient Count Tracking
✔️ Age Group Breakdown
✔️ Wait Time Analysis by Hour
✔️ Interactive Charts & Clean UI

💡 This dashboard helps visualize key insights like:
Peak wait times during the day 🕒
Which age groups visit most 🧓👦
Trends in satisfaction scores over the year 🌟

💪 Tools used: Excel functions, PivotTables, Data Visualization, Conditional Formatting & more — proving Excel is still a powerful tool for analytics!
